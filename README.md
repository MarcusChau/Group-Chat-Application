# Multithreaded Chat application

This is a chat that utilizes multithreads.


## How it works ##

This chat uses 2 threads, one for accepting the user input(Using the Scanner class) and the other for reading the messages sent from other clients.
This program is exectued on a single machine. This utilizes socket programming and is just the bare bones logic of how multithreading would work in a chatting application.

**Key term**:
A MulticastSocket is a (UDP) DatagramSocket, with additional capabilities for joining “groups” of other multicast hosts on the internet.


## Prerequisites ##

> Java Installed

Understanding of socket programming and multithreading is necessary.

##Improvements##

The project would be even more fascinating if the front-end is developed. 
You can use either Java’s AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) or its advanced counterpart, Java Swing to develop the front end. 

>FYI: I have started using Java Swing to develop the front-end

**Additional notes**:
- Incorporating network security feature by performing an encryption and decryption
  - Caesar cipher or advanced methods such as RSA can be used to perform encryption-decryption, or Java’s RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
 
 
## Technology Stack ##

- Java

The use of java's io, net, and util library was necessary in order to create this.
